# Shatrunjaya Research Notes

## Key Findings from Wikipedia:

### Geography:
- "A path along the ridge descends into the Aadpur Valley, covering a distance of approximately 13 kilometres (8.1 mi)"
- "The town of Palitana is situated at the base of the foothills, around 56 kilometres (35 mi) from Bhavnagar"
- Two main hills with a river between them

### Culture/Pilgrimage:
- "The Palitana temples, a sacred pilgrimage complex located on both hills and the saddle between them, are accessed by ascending approximately 3,750 stone steps carved into the mountain"
- "The climb spans about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) from the base and typically takes around two hours"
- Pilgrims circumambulate the Shatrunjaya Hills, covering approximately 216 km on foot

### From Facebook (Gheti Paag Yatra):
- "All the blessed souls who perform 2 yatras of Shetrunjay in one day, climb down to Gheti Paag and start their second yatra from here"
- "After reaching the top of Shetrunjay, they come out from Sagaal Pol into Kuntasar Chowk. The way going towards left takes you down to Gheti Paag"
- "Then climbing down from the main way completes the second yatra"
- Gheti Paag is at the bottom, has memorial temple with footprints of Shree Aadeshwar Bhagwan
- Below Gheti Paag is Aadpur village
